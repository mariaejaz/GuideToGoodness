							<p><strong>SHEIKH BABIKIR AHMED BABIKIR is a well respected Islamic scholar, teacher and public speaker.</strong></p>


							<p>Sheikh Babikir was born in Sudan. He descends in lineage from Sayyiduna al-'Abbas ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib (رضي الله عنه) through his father and Sayyiduna Abu Bakr as-Siddiq (رضي الله عنه) through his mother.</p>

							<p>Sheikh Babikir completed his studies of traditional Islamic Sciences under many great Scholars and Sheikhs of Africa and the Middle East. He studied, through authentic chains of transmission, the sciences of Tafsir (exegesis), Aqida (theology), Hadith (prophetic tradition), Seerah (the life and way the Prophet ﷺ), Maliki Fiqh (jurisprudence), Ta’wil-ahadith (dream interpretation) and Tasawwuf  (sufism).  As a young man, he was initiated into the Sammaniya tariqa (sufi order) and later, he was granted the most honourable Ijaza (authorisation) of becoming a spiritual guide by the grand-sage Sheikh al-Fatih Qaribullah (رحمه الله). He went on to receive Ijazas from other spiritual luminaries such as Sheikh Salih al-Jaʿfari (رحمه الله), Sheikh Nazim al-Haqqani (رحمه الله) and Sheikh Muhammad ibn `Alawi al-Maliki (رحمه الله). A sign of his rare prestige is the Ijaza he has received from many renowned scholars in Dalial al-Khayrat, a book of Remembrance of Blessings upon the Chosen Prophet ﷺ.</p>


							<p>Arriving in Britain in 1977, Sheikh Babikir has been working hard to promote Islam’s spiritual message in the UK. He began organising programs at London Central Mosque in Regent's Park, and in Muslim Welfare House in North London, where he first met His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales. The Sheikh served for some time as a member of the board for Mosaic (a charity founded by the Prince of Wales) at the request of His Highness.</p>

							<p>Upon settling in London, Sheikh Babikir was instructed by his Sheikh, Sheikh al-Fatih Qaribullah (رحمه الله), to serve as a teacher and guide. He completed a B.Ed degree in Mathematics at Greenwich University as well as a Certificate in Personnel Management and Diploma in Administrative Management.</p>

							<p>Up until recently Sheikh Babikir was working as the Imam and spiritual director at the Islamia Schools Centre, founded by Yusuf Islam (Cat Stevens) in 1983. Whilst there, he provided teacher training and assisted in educational workshops and conferences.</p>

							<p>Sheikh Babikir is the Director and Founder of Rumi’s Cave, a vibrant community hub in North-West London, as well as Ulfa Aid, a global humanitarian relief charity. Loved by many for his warm manner and wise counsel, he continues to spread his message of compassion and mercy with an unmistakable charm across the UK and abroad.</p>
